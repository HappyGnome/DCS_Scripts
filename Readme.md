# Readme

This repository contains some lua scripts for making DCS World missions:
* HeLMS - "Helpful Library of Mission Scripts" - contains common utilities for the other scripts. A lightweight substitute for MIST (formerly a dependency).
* Asset Pools - Scripts for spawning groups automatically to keep a mission alive, and managing resources to be spawned via the F10 menu
* Hitch Troopers - Allows for dynamically spawning, transporting and controlling (semi) intelligent infantry groups
* Steersman - Scripting for controlling aircraft carrier routes, accounting for wind etc.

See the individual module Readme files for more information.
